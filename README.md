This is my submission for Project 06, the 3D RPG

## Implementation
- Player character with blaster and movement
- Camera that follows the character
- Drone that flies overhead, attacking when directly under it
- Targets that can be shot for points, disappear when shot
- NPC who provides dialogue
- Terrain
- PBR Textures to Objects
- Scoring System
- Timer
- Goal to destroy all targets and the drone!
